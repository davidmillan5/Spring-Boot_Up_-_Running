# Spring Boot: Up and Running: Building Cloud Native Java and Kotlin Applications

In this repository based on the O'Really book [Spring Boot: Up and Running: Building Cloud Native Java and Kotlin Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Boot-Running-Building-Applications/dp/1492076988) from the author [Mark Heckler](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/mark-heckler) I practice the exercises present to enhance my skill using [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/).

Some of the tools that I use while training from this text books are:

- [Spring Initialzr](https://start.spring.io/)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)
- [Spring Boot: Up and Running: Building Cloud Native Java and Kotlin Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Boot-Running-Building-Applications/dp/1492076988)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)


I hope to keep updating this readme with more insights and notes for better understanding....
